 This repository demonstrates how to **parse a website table** (with pagination) and export the results to **CSV** and **SQLite**.  It uses a **local demo site** (`/site/page1.html` → `page2.html` → `page3.html`) that contains intentionally messy data  (missing emails, inconsistent phone formats, mixed casing) so you can practice **cleaning and standardizing**.
